# Overview
Welcome to the [Phemex](https://phemex.com) API documentation. We offer REST and Websocket APIs to interact with our systems.

## General API information
* Rest API base endpoints:
  * Default endpoint: **https://api.phemex.com**
  * High rate-limit endpoint: **https://vapi.phemex.com**
  * TestNet endpoint: **https://testnet-api.phemex.com**
* WebSocket API base endpoints:
  * Default endpoint: **wss://ws.phemex.com**<br>
    Note: URI or querystring not allowed; 
  * TestNet endpoint: **wss://testnet-api.phemex.com/ws**<br>
    Note: URI or querystring not allowed; 
  * High rate-limit endpoint: **wss://vapi.phemex.com/ws**<br>
* Phemex provides HTTPS Rest API for client to operate Orders, all endpoints return a JSON object. 

## REST API Standards
### HTTP return codes

* HTTP `401` return code is used when unauthenticated
* HTTP `403` return code is used when lack of priviledge.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request ratelimit.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for Phemex internal errors. Note: This doesn't means the operation failed, the execution status is **UNKNOWN** and could be Succeed.

### REST request header

Every HTTP Rest Request must have the following Headers:

* **x-phemex-access-token** : This is *API-KEY* (id field) from Phemex site.
* **x-phemex-request-expiry** : This describes the Unix *EPoch SECONDS* to expire the request, normally it should be (Now() + 1 minute)
* **x-phemex-request-signature** : This is HMAC SHA256 signature of the http request. Secret is *API Secret*, its formula is : HMacSha256(URL Path + QueryString + Expiry + body)
* (Optional) **x-phemex-request-tracing**: a unique string to trace http-request, less than 40 bytes. This header is a must in resolving latency issues.

### REST response format

> Response general format

```javascript
{
  "code": <code>,
  "msg": <msg>,
  "data": <data>
}
```

* All restful API except ***starting*** with `/md` shares same response format.

| Field | Description |
|-------|------|
| code | 0 means `success`, non-zero means `error`|
| msg  | when code is non-zero, it gives short error description |
| data | operation dependant |

## Rate limits
* In order to protect the exchange, Phemex apply `API RateLimit` and `IP Ratelimit` on all requests.
* Rest API has a request capacity in one minute window on user basis.
* IP has request capacity in 5 minutes window.
* Ratelimit of API is **independant** of that in WEB/APP, so if one get ratelimited in API, one can place/cancel orders via WEB or APP.
* **https://testnet-api.phemex.com** and **wss://testnet-api.phemex.com/ws** shared across rate limit 500/5m in total
* **wss://ws.phemex.com** rate limit 200/5m

### IP ratelimits
   Currently Phemex restricts every IP 5,000 REST API requests in 5 minutes window.
   If exceeded this IP capacity, the user would be blocked in the following 5 minutes.

### REST API ratelimit rules
* [Order spamming limitations](https://phemex.com/user-guides/order-spamming-limitations)
* All Phemex APIs are divided into 3 groups, `contract`, `spotOrder` and `others`.
* All APIs in the same group share a request capacity.
* Every API consume request shares at its own weight.
* If exceeded the ratelimit, http status 429 will returned, together with a reset seconds header `x-ratelimit-retry-after-<groupName>`
* Ratelimit headers
  Below headers are returned with API response. Postfix `-<groupName>` is empty if group is others

| Header name  | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| x-ratelimit-remaining-*groupName*   | Remaining request permits in this minute |
| x-ratelimit-capacity-*groupName*    | Request ratelimit capacity |
| x-ratelimit-retry-after-*groupName* | Reset timeout in seconds for current ratelimited user |

* Group capacity

| Group Name | Capacity |
|------------|---------|
| Contract   |  500/minute |
| SpotOrder  |  500/minute |
| Others     |  100/minute |
